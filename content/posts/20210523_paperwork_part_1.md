I started working at a Maltese company before I arrived in Malta. When I found what will be my permanent address, I started to fill more and more forms.

## Social security number
This is one of the easiest. You can do it online, fill in 2 pages, submit, you get a confirmation mail, then in few days also in the mail you have your SSN. [Here](https://socialsecurity.gov.mt/en/information-and-applications-for-benefits-and-services/registration-for-a-social-security-number/) you find detailed instructions and at the bottom the link to the form.

When you get it, they note it for you this is just a number, does not mean you are insured, you (or your employer) have to pay that.

## Tax number
Another easy round. However it can be confusing, it says on multiple pages, you don't need to apply for tax number separately if you already applied to SSN.
Actually, I did not find any email I sent, I just found once my letter from the tax authorities with my tax number in my (afk) mailbox.

## ID and residence permit
If you stay more than 3 months, you have to have a residence permit that comes with the e-Id.
I started by emailing them the required forms, namely `CEA Form A`, `CEA FORM-ID-1A`, `CEA GDPR`, and supporting documents.

I submitted them through email. On `2nd of March`. I got a reply, saying they got the email on `15th of March`.
Then on `28th of April` I got another letter, that I have an appointment for `20th of May`.
I was warned this will be a lengthy process so I was not in panic, and here you have your detailed warning of what to expect regarding time.

To that appointment, you need to print everything and go to the Identity Malta office. It is a really nice office and building quite new, not even updated on Google maps.
Separate entrance for EU "customers".

They handled the covid situation really well too. Probably one more reason for the far in time appointment. Only a few people were asked to enter the building, there was enough place inside to keep the distance.  

The officers were super nice and helpful, especially as my case got a bit interesting (see [story time](#story-time) below). I was done in less than half an hour, they took all my documents, a photo of me, I signed on a digital pad then good to go. They said I will get a mail telling me to go again to the office for picking up the ID (I don't know when ðŸ˜„ )

### Story time
> Remember I wrote I had a Maltese employer when I arrived. On the Id forms you need to provide that information, or that you are self-employed. No brainer for me, that time. But life is life, I quit that job, I already had the appointment when it happened. \
I knew I will move to the self-employed status, so all my submitted forms are wrong now. But the appointment mail says print and bring everything you sent or you won't get the Id. \
\
Ok, I started to get the stuff needed for self-employment see [https://jobsplus.gov.mt/](https://jobsplus.gov.mt/) and I brought that with me next to the originally submitted stuff.
When it was my turn in the office, I gave them the copies and told them that my situation changed recently. \
\
The lady looked confused or panicking at first, said this is wrong, I need to submit a new application. We went through how I got here keeping in mind the situation changed really close to the appointment. She suddenly disappeared for about 10 minutes, came back, noted the change on my prints. \
\
Probably I will need to do more around the self-employment stuff but that is another round. Hopefully, I will get the Id soon and then as most of the governmental portals work with eId login, it will be easier to proceed.
