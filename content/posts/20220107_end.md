PSA: If you are around Malta, do SCUBA DIVING !

I had to add that before I close this blog for good.  
It did not last long did it? :D   
But it was nice the whole time <3

{{< youtube DKBimpT2Ttw >}}

It was obvious for some time that I lost motivation composing posts here. Things did not progress in the pace I expected and I forgot the first part when the second finally happened, and I did not have the discipline to take notes and publish when ready.
I did not want to publish misleading, half baked info. It is much bigger effort than you imagine, respect people who wan organize and manage this.
Also, I left Malta so it would not be authentic to continue on this address.


I deleted the instagram page, it spammed me with useless annoying notifications.
I will keep this site here, as a reminder or whatever.
